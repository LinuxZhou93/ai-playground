See for example the\n<a href=\"./springs/single-spring-en.html\">Single Spring</a> simulation.\n</p>\n\n<ul id=\"sim-steps\">\n\n<li>A physics simulation starts with a <em>mathematical model</em> whose variables\ndefine the state of the system at a given time. Each variable represents the position\nor velocity of some part of the system.\n</li>\n\n<li>The heart of a physics simulation is the\n<a href=\"./explain/what-is-a-diff-eq-en.html\">set of differential equations</a>\nthat describe how the variables evolve over time. The forces and geometry determine\nthe equations.\n</li>\n\n<li>The next step is <em>getting the computer to solve the equations</em>, a process\nthat goes by the name <a href=\"./explain/numerical-solution-en.html\">numerical analysis</a>.\nThe <a href=\"./explain/runge-kutta-en.html\">Runge Kutta method</a> is a popular choice.\n</li>\n\n<li>For simulations that involve <em>collisions</em> there are additional steps:\nwe need to detect the collision and then\n<a href=\"./springs/collide-blocks-en.html#collisions\">back up in time</a> to the moment before\nthe collision to modify the velocities.\n</li>\n\n<li>Finally, there are lots of programming details about\n<a href=\"develop/docs/Architecture.html#view\">how to represent objects</a> on the\ncomputer display, how to\n<a href=\"develop/docs/Architecture.html#controller\">handle user input</a>, how to\n<a href=\"develop/docs/Architecture.html#event-drivenprogramming\">synchronize with real time</a>,\nand so on.\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"./explain/physics-engine-en.html\">rigid body physics engine</a> is the most\nsophisticated simulation shown here. It is capable of replicating all of the other more\nspecialized simulations. The physics engine handles\n<a href=\"./engine2D/collision-en.html\">collisions</a> and also calculates\n<a href=\"./engine2D/contact-en.html\">contact forces</a> which allow objects to push against each\nother.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"./explain/links-en.html\">links to other physics websites</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"units\">Units Of Measurement</h2>\n\n<p>The myPhysicsLab simulations do not have units of measurements specified such as\nmeters, kilograms, seconds. The units are <em>dimensionless</em>, they can be\ninterpreted however you want, but they must be <em>consistent within the\nsimulation</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>For example if we regard a unit of distance as <em>one meter</em> and a unit of time\nas <em>one second</em>, then a unit of velocity must be <em>one meter/second</em>.\n</p>\n\n<p>See the discussion\n<a href=\"./develop/docs/Architecture.html#aboutunitsofmeasurement\">About Units Of Measurement</a>\nin the myPhysicsLab Documentation.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"about_me\">About the Author</h2>\n\n<img src=\"home-page/erik_photo.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"320\"\n    style=\"float: left; margin: 10px;\" alt=\"photo of Erik Neumann\">\n\n<p>Hi, my name is <a href=\"mailto:erikn@MyPhysicsLab.com\">Erik Neumann</a>, I live in\nSeattle, WA, USA, and I am a self-employed software engineer. I started developing this\nwebsite in 2001, both as a personal project to learn scientific computing, and with a\nvision of developing an online science museum. I grew up in Chicago near the\n<a href=\"http://www.msichicago.org/\">Museum of Science and Industry</a> which I loved\nto visit and learn about science and math.\n</p>\n\n<p>I got a BA in Mathematics at Oberlin College, Ohio, 1978, and an MBA from Univerity\nof Chicago, 1984. My first software jobs were using the language\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)\">APL</a> which I\nenjoyed for its math-like conciseness and power.\n</p>\n\n<p>I was fortunate to get involved in the Macintosh software industry early on in 1985,\njoining\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacroMind\">MacroMind</a>, which became\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia\">Macromedia</a>. I led the software\ndevelopment at MacroMind as VP of Engineering for 5 years. Our most significant product\nwas VideoWorks, which was renamed Director, and lives on today as\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Director\">Adobe Director</a>. In the\n1980's, the interactive multimedia concepts that are so common today were new and being\ndeveloped. VideoWorks was mainly an animation tool, but also incorporated programmable\ninteractivity. Our main competitors at that time were HyperCard, SuperCard, and\nAuthorware. Director was used in many different ways; I am most proud that it became\nthe preferred way to prototype software user interfaces for a time during the 90's.\nDirector was also used to develop the introductory \"guided tour\" tutorial that came\nwith the Macintosh in the early years. And of course, Director was used for all sorts\nof art, design, and marketing projects.\n</p>\n\n<p>I went on to work at Apple Computer on new multimedia and user interface concepts\ninvolving digital agents, animated user interfaces, speech recognition and distributed\ninformation access. In 1991, there was a sudden flurry of activity when Apple and IBM\nwere trying to set up a strategic partnership. I became involved in the super-secret\nnegotiations, and made the suggestion that what the world needed was a standard for\nmultimedia that multimedia content creators could rely on to publish to (ultimately\nthis is what HTML became). Based on these suggestions,\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleida_Labs\">Kaleida Labs</a> was founded. Our\nwork there developed a product called\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleida_Labs#Features_of_ScriptX\">ScriptX</a>,\nwhich turned out to be very similar to Sun's Java which was being developed at the same\ntime. ScriptX had goals of supporting all forms of multimedia: text, images, audio,\nvideo, animation; being cross-platform (Mac and Windows), interpreted, object oriented,\nwith a garbage collector to manage memory.\n</p>\n\n<p>I then moved to Seattle and turned my attention back to mathematics and science. I\nrelearned calculus by doing all the problems in my old college text book and took\nfurther math classes at the University of Washington. I started developing this website\nas a way to practice what I was learning. I am now happy to use excellent tools such as\nHTML and JavaScript, and leave their development to others. I continue to work on\nphysics simulations, with several new ones in development.\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"./archive/archive-en.html\">Archive</a> of older projects.</p>\n\n<p id=\"page_history\">\n  This web page was first published April 2001.\n</p>\n\n<div id=\"footer2\" >\n  <div id=\"copyright\">\n  &copy; <a href=\"mailto:erikn@myPhysicsLab.com\" \n  title=\"send comments to Erik Neumann\">\n  Erik Neumann</a>,  2004-2021<br>\n  <span id=\"revised_date\">revised Dec 19 2023 9:56</span>\n</div> \n  <a class=\"nav_link\" href=\"./engine2D/collision-methods-en.html\">previous</a>\n  <a class=\"nav_link\" href=\"./springs/single-spring-en.html\">next</a>\n  <a id=",
